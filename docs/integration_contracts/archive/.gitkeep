# Archive Directory

This directory stores historical contract versions for audit trail purposes.

When a contract is superseded by a new version, move the old contract here with its original filename.

Example:
- `podio-schema-v1.0.json` (moved here when v1.1 becomes active)
- `podio-schema-v1.1.json` (moved here when v2.0 becomes active)

Keep all archived contracts indefinitely for compliance and historical reference.
